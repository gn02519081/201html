My name is Allen Liao, welcome to my ePortfolio. Here you are going to learn about my strengths, achievements, and goals in life.  

I was born and raised in Taipei, Taiwan, and currently reside in Salt Lake City, UT. I have been to many different countries to gain a wider vision of the world village in my life. I have a diverse culture background and speak 4 different languages fluently(Mandarin,English French, Taiwanese).  Exploring new things and overcoming different challenges are the joys in my life.
